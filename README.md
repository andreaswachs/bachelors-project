## Daaukins

Daaukins is a vertical slice implementation of [Haaukins](https://github.com/aau-network-security/haaukins) that attemts to explore the possibility having a working cyber security platform while being horizontally scalable.

The Daaukins server is only runnable on linux due to linux only support for macvlan networks.

- Go v1.19 or newer
- Docker
- docker-compose
